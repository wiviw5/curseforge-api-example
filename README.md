### **Installation Requirements:**

This has only been tested to work on [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 3.10. Versions **BELOW** this version may not work.

This uses the pip package [requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/), and will not work without it. Installation guide can be found within the link.

This should work on all operating systems, please report if it does not..
